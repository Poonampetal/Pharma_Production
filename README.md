# Pharma_Production
<br>
This project aims to analyze and explore relationships between supplier lead times and production delays using Python's Pandas and NumPy libraries. The primary goal is to identify key trends, outliers, and correlations that impact supply chain efficiency, production timelines, and customer satisfaction.
<br>
Key Findings & Insights -
<br>
Suppliers with longer lead times tend to have higher production delays, impacting order fulfillment.
<br>
A negative correlation exists between delivery delays and customer ratingsâ€”longer delays result in lower ratings.
<br>
Inventory shortages significantly impact sales, with certain products showing demand spikes before going out of stock.
<br>
